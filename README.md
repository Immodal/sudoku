# Sudoku
 
This is the repo for my P5JS app that solves Sudoku puzzles using a variety of algorithms and an emphasis on using the functional 
programming style (weaving in more as I learn). Check it out in the link in the About section of this page!

I also write about the algorithms and the development of the app on my blog:
